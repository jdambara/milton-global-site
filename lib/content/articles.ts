# What is Ultancy? Complete Guide to MetaQuotes Matching Engine

Ultancy represents a significant evolution in forex and CFD trading infrastructure. As MetaQuotes' revolutionary ultra-low latency matching engine, Ultancy is specifically designed for the MetaTrader 5 platform, providing brokers with an integrated solution for liquidity aggregation, order matching, and comprehensive risk management.

## Understanding Ultancy's Core Technology

Ultancy is a native MT5 solution that enables reliable connections to multiple liquidity providers simultaneously. Unlike traditional bridge solutions that require external systems, Ultancy is built directly into the MetaTrader 5 architecture, utilizing highly efficient internal data transfer protocols between cluster components.

This native integration delivers several critical advantages:

- **Sub-10ms execution times** through optimized internal protocols
- **Seamless configuration** with all parameters managed within MT5
- **Unified logging** with all execution and client data in one place
- **Enhanced security** with broker-exclusive dedicated platforms

## Key Features of the Ultancy Matching Engine

### 1. Multiple Liquidity Provider Access

Ultancy provides brokers with an intuitive gallery of approved liquidity providers, including institutional names like Milton Global. Brokers can connect to multiple LPs with just a few clicks, eliminating the traditional complexity of individual bridge setups and negotiations.

### 2. Intelligent Price Aggregation

The matching engine continuously aggregates prices from all connected liquidity providers, automatically selecting the best bid and ask prices for each instrument. This ensures clients receive optimal pricing on every trade while brokers maintain competitive spreads.

### 3. Ultra-Low Latency Execution

With execution times consistently below 10 milliseconds, Ultancy delivers institutional-grade performance. The system's architecture is optimized for speed, processing orders through efficient internal protocols that eliminate unnecessary hops and delays.

### 4. Comprehensive Risk Management

Ultancy offers sophisticated risk management capabilities including:

- **A-Book, B-Book, and C-Book execution models** with flexible routing
- **Automatic position coverage** based on volume, exposure, or profit thresholds
- **Client group profiling** for differentiated execution strategies
- **Real-time risk monitoring** through dedicated coverage accounts

### 5. Cost Efficiency

By consolidating connections through Ultancy, brokers significantly reduce infrastructure and maintenance costs. Instead of managing individual bridges to multiple LPs, brokers maintain a single Ultancy connection, simplifying operations and reducing technical overhead.

## How Ultancy Works for Brokers

When a client places an order through MetaTrader 5, Ultancy processes it through the following workflow:

1. **Order Reception**: The order enters the Ultancy matching engine
2. **Price Aggregation**: Ultancy queries all connected LPs for current pricing
3. **Best Price Selection**: The system identifies the best available price
4. **Risk Check**: Configured risk management rules are applied
5. **Execution**: The order is routed appropriately (A-Book to LP, B-Book internally, or C-Book with partial hedge)
6. **Confirmation**: Execution details are logged and confirmed to the client

This entire process occurs in milliseconds, ensuring clients experience no delays or requotes.

## Benefits for Different Broker Types

### Retail Brokers

Retail brokers benefit from Ultancy's ability to offer competitive spreads while maintaining profitability through intelligent order routing. The system's B-Book capabilities allow brokers to internalize profitable flow while hedging risky positions with LPs.

### Institutional Brokers

For institutional brokers offering direct market access, Ultancy provides pure A-Book execution with multiple LP connections, ensuring deep liquidity and tight spreads for high-volume clients.

### Hybrid Brokers

Brokers operating hybrid models can leverage Ultancy's flexible routing to optimize profitability. Client groups can be configured with different execution strategies based on their trading profiles and profitability.

## Technical Infrastructure

Ultancy's technical architecture is built for performance and reliability:

- **Dedicated Platforms**: Each broker receives their own Ultancy instance
- **Geographic Flexibility**: Choose server locations based on LP proximity
- **Cluster Architecture**: Redundant systems ensure continuous operation
- **Internal Protocols**: Optimized data transfer between components
- **Centralized Configuration**: All settings managed within MT5

## Comparing Ultancy to Traditional Solutions

Traditional LP integration requires brokers to:
- Set up individual bridge software for each LP

- Deal with compatibility issues and updates

Ultancy eliminates these challenges by providing:
- Single integration point for multiple LPs
- Unified configuration within MT5

# FSA Regulation Explained: Why Seychelles Licensing Matters

The Seychelles Financial Services Authority (FSA) has emerged as a respected regulatory body for forex and CFD brokers operating internationally. Understanding FSA regulation is crucial for both brokers seeking licensure and traders evaluating broker credibility.

## What is the Seychelles FSA?

The Seychelles Financial Services Authority is the regulatory body responsible for supervising and regulating the financial services industry in the Republic of Seychelles. Established under the Financial Services Authority Act 2013, the FSA ensures that all licensed entities operate with integrity, transparency, and in accordance with international standards.

The FSA regulates various financial services including:
- Securities dealing (CFDs, forex, derivatives)
- Investment advisory services
- Fund management
- Banking services
- Insurance services

## Why Seychelles FSA Regulation Matters

### 1. Client Fund Protection

FSA-regulated brokers must maintain segregated client accounts, keeping client funds completely separate from operational capital. This ensures that client money is protected even if the broker faces financial difficulties.

### 2. Capital Requirements

The FSA imposes strict minimum capital requirements on licensed brokers, ensuring they maintain sufficient financial resources to operate safely and meet all client obligations.

### 3. Regular Audits and Oversight

FSA-licensed entities undergo regular audits and regulatory oversight, providing ongoing assurance of compliance with financial and operational standards.

### 4. Transparent Operations

Regulatory requirements mandate transparent pricing, fair execution, clear disclosure of risks, and comprehensive terms and conditions that protect traders.

## FSA Licensing Requirements

To obtain and maintain an FSA license, brokers must:

- Meet minimum capital requirements (typically $50,000 - $100,000)
- Maintain segregated client accounts with approved banks
- Implement comprehensive compliance and AML procedures
- Provide regular financial reporting to the FSA
- Maintain professional indemnity insurance
- Employ qualified compliance officers
- Submit to regular audits and inspections

### Credibility

## Comparing FSA to Other Jurisdictions

- **Competitive regulatory costs** without compromising standards
